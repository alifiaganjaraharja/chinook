# [Chinook] - Music Store Analysis Project
By Alifia Ganjaraharja

## Project Overview:
This is a classic project using the Chinook database, which mimics a digital music store like iTunes. It's perfect for people who are practicing fundamental concepts like joins and aggregations. 
1. **Goals**: Act as a data analyst for the music store and provide insights to the marketing team, and analyze the top market from this store, the top artists, genre popularity, and customer value by determining who is the best customer.

**Sample Questions to Answer**:
- Top Markets: Which countries have the most invoices? This will help the marketing team decide where to focus their campaigns.
- Top Artists: Who are the top 10 best-selling artists?
- Genre Popularity: Which music genre is the most popular in the USA? Analyze sales by genre to inform purchasing decisions.
- Customer Value: Who is our best customer? Identify the customer who has spent the most money.
  
2. **Dataset**: The dataset used for this project was downloaded from the SQLite Tutorial website. You can download the full dataset [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) or find it within this repository under the file name 'chinook.db' (This dataset is available for SQL Server, MySQL, and more.).
